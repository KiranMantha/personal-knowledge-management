## From a 2020 academic paper about Chinese equities to a working MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor with CVaR risk management — including every backtest that failed before one finally didn’t

Most algorithmic trading articles start with a strategy that already works. This one doesn’t.

This is the honest story of taking a peer-reviewed paper written for China’s A-share equity market, stripping it to its mathematical core, and rebuilding those ideas as a working MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor for forex. It includes the backtest that lost money, the three bugs that silently killed trades without a single error in the journal, and the decisions that eventually produced a Sharpe ratio of 2.79 on a full year of data.

By the end you’ll find the complete source code and the real results. But more importantly, you’ll understand why each piece of the system exists — not just what it does.

## The Paper

**“Financial Trading Strategy System Based on Machine Learning” — Chen et al., Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2020**

It’s not a forex paper. It’s not even a short-term trading paper. Chen et al. built a quarterly rebalancing system for Chinese A-share stocks using fundamental factors: ROE, P/E ratios, cash flow metrics, beta, turnover rate. Their universe was 50 companies over ten years (2008–2018).

So why does any of this matter for a currency trader?

Because the mathematical architecture underneath the stock-picking is completely universal. Three ideas in this paper apply to any tradeable instrument regardless of asset class or timeframe: multi-factor scoring with learned importance weights, CVaR-constrained position sizing, and minimum variance allocation. Strip away the Chinese equities context and you have a rigorous framework for combining weak signals into disciplined, risk-aware trading decisions. That’s what we built.

## Part 1 — What the Paper Actually Does

## The three-layer architecture

The system runs three sequential stages. Every decision flows through this pipeline:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│         LAYER 1 — FACTOR SCORING        │  
│  Input:  Financial / price factors      │  
│  Model:  LightGBM gradient boosting     │  
│  Output: Predicted return score         │  
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
                   │  
                   ▼  
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│       LAYER 2 — ASSET SELECTION         │  
│  Rank by predicted score                │  
│  Filter below minimum threshold         │  
│  Select top candidates only             │  
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
                   │  
                   ▼  
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│     LAYER 3 — PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION      │  
│  Minimize variance + CVaR constraint    │  
│  Output: Position size per asset        │  
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The model at the heart of Layer 1 is LightGBM. The paper compared three approaches:

```
Model        R² Score    Training Speed  
────────────────────────────────────────  
GLM           0.443          Fast  
XGBoost       0.771          Slow  
LightGBM      0.798       Fastest  ✓
```

LightGBM wins for two technical reasons. It grows trees leaf-wise rather than level-wise, finding better splits per iteration. And its Exclusive Feature Bundling compresses sparse correlated features without losing information — critical when you have dozens of financial ratios.

## The variable importance chart — the real insight

Figure 4 of the paper is the most important thing in it. After training, LightGBM assigns an importance score to each factor:

```
Close_Price    ████████████████████████  235  
AP             ████████                   48  
Price_Rate     ██████                     42  
Turnover_Rate  █████                      38  
Beta           ████                       32  
ROE            ███                        28  
P/E Ratio      ██                         19
```

Close\_Price scores 235. The second factor scores 48. Price is nearly five times more predictive than any fundamental metric. The model, trained purely on data, revealed that this is a momentum system with a fundamental overlay — not the other way around. This single finding completely determines how we adapt the paper to forex.

## Why CVaR and not just a stop loss

The paper uses CVaR — Conditional Value at Risk — as its risk constraint. Most traders know VaR, but CVaR is fundamentally more useful for fat-tailed distributions like forex returns.

```
Return distribution:
```

```
  Frequency  
     |      ╭────╮  
     |    ╭─╯    ╰─╮  
     |  ╭─╯        ╰─╮  
     |╭─╯             ╰──────────────  
     └────────────────────────────── Return  
                   │         │  
                  VaR       CVaR  
                 (5%)       (5%)  
                   │         │  
             "You lose     "On your worst  
             less than     days, you lose  
             this 95%      THIS on average"  
             of days"
```

VaR only tells you the threshold. CVaR tells you what happens beyond it — the expected loss in the worst 5% of scenarios. For fat-tailed distributions, CVaR can be dramatically larger than VaR. If you’re only measuring VaR, you’re blind to the risk that actually matters most.

The paper’s formula for parametric CVaR:

```
CVaR = -(μ - σ × φ(z) / (1 - α))
```

```
  μ      = mean log return over lookback window  
  σ      = standard deviation of returns  
  φ(z)   = standard normal PDF at confidence level z  
  α      = confidence level (0.95)
```

## Part 2 — The Translation Problem

You cannot run LightGBM inside MetaTrader 5. There is no Python runtime, no model serialization, no way to load a trained gradient boosting model into MQL5. This is the core engineering challenge.

The solution is to replicate the *output behavior* of LightGBM rather than the model itself. A trained model takes multiple input features and returns a score between 0 and 1. We can build a weighted scoring system that does exactly the same thing — using the feature importance values from the paper directly as weights.

## Replacing fundamental factors with forex equivalents

The paper’s factors are quarterly balance sheet data. Forex has no balance sheet. We need technical signals that capture the same underlying phenomena:

```
PAPER FACTOR           IMPORTANCE   FOREX EQUIVALENT  
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Close_Price              235        Price momentum (z-score vs MA)  
Price_Rate                42        Rate of change (10-bar ROC)  
Turnover_Rate             38        Relative volume  
Beta                      32        ADX + DI divergence  
ROE / ROA                 28        RSI with divergence detection  
P/B Ratio                 19        Bollinger Band position  
ROS                       15        CCI with slope
```

The weights in our scoring system come directly from the paper’s importance scores, normalized to sum to 1. Momentum gets weight 90. Rate of change gets 75. ADX gets 65. This isn’t arbitrary — we’re encoding the paper’s empirical finding that price behavior dominates everything else.

## The scoring engine

Each feature returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 means strong bullish signal. The final score is a weighted average:

```
score = Σ ( weight[i] × feature_score[i] )
```

```
Entry LONG  when score ≥ 0.60  AND  6+ features agree (score > 0.55)  
Entry SHORT when inverse score ≥ 0.60  AND  6+ features agree
```

Here’s the RSI feature calculation as an example, including divergence detection:

```
double rsi  = buf_RSI[1];  
double rsip = buf_RSI[2];  // previous bar
```

```
double score;  
if(rsi < 25.0)      score = 0.82 + (25.0 - rsi) / 100.0;  
else if(rsi < 40.0) score = 0.65 + (40.0 - rsi) / 100.0;  
else if(rsi < 50.0) score = 0.52;  
else if(rsi < 60.0) score = 0.48;  
else if(rsi < 75.0) score = 0.35 - (rsi - 60.0) / 100.0;  
else                score = 0.18 - (rsi - 75.0) / 100.0;// Divergence: RSI rising but price falling = bearish divergence  
if(rsi > rsip && price < prev_price) score -= 0.05;  
if(rsi < rsip && price > prev_price) score += 0.05;
```

## Part 3 — The First Backtest and What Went Wrong

The first version ran on EURUSD H4 over a full year. The results were bad in an instructive way:

```
Initial deposit:   $900  
Net profit:       -$75.24  
Profit Factor:     0.91      ← needs to be > 1.0  
Win Rate:         48%  
Avg win:          $12.68  
Avg loss:         $12.86     ← larger than avg win  
Max Drawdown:     23.16%  
Sharpe Ratio:    -1.04
```

A profit factor below 1.0 means losses mathematically exceed gains by definition. With a 48% win rate, you need average wins to exceed average losses by roughly 10% just to break even. Ours were actually smaller. Every single trade had negative expected value.

Three structural problems caused this:

**No market regime filter.** The EA was entering trades in ranging markets where momentum strategies lose consistently. From August onward the market moved sideways and the system kept firing on weak, ambiguous signals.

**Score threshold too low.** At 0.55 with only 6 features required to agree, the system was entering on noise. The bar was too low.

**The trailing stop was completely broken** — three separate bugs, none of which produced any error message in the MT5 journal.

## Part 4 — Fixing It

## The regime filter

Only trade when the market is actually trending. Simple in concept, transformative in practice:

```
void DetectMarketRegime()  
{  
   double adx     = buf_ADX[1];  
   double dip     = buf_DI_P[1];  
   double dim     = buf_DI_M[1];  
   double di_diff = MathAbs(dip - dim);
```

```
   // Trending = ADX above minimum AND DI lines separated  
   is_trending = (adx >= 18.0 && di_diff > 4.0);  
}
```

We also added a higher timeframe check. If the daily chart shows a downtrend (price below EMA50, EMA falling, DI- dominant), long entries are blocked regardless of H4 signals. This alone eliminated a large portion of losing trades by stopping the EA from fighting the dominant direction.

## The three trailing stop bugs

**Bug 1 — Stale ATR between candles.** The ATR buffer only updates at the start of each new candle, but ManagePosition runs on every tick. Between candles, `buf_ATR[1]` was the value from the previous bar — or zero. The fix reads the indicator handle directly on every tick:

```
// WRONG — only updates on new candle  
double atr = buf_ATR[1];
```

```
// CORRECT — fresh read from handle on every tick  
double atr_buf[];  
ArraySetAsSeries(atr_buf, true);  
CopyBuffer(h_ATR, 0, 0, 3, atr_buf);  
double atr = atr_buf[1];
```

**Bug 2 — SYMBOL\_TRADE\_STOPS\_LEVEL ignored.** Every broker enforces a minimum distance between the current price and any stop loss. If PositionModify places the new SL too close, MT5 silently rejects it — no error, no journal entry, the stop simply doesn’t move:

```
long   stops_lvl = SymbolInfoInteger(_Symbol, SYMBOL_TRADE_STOPS_LEVEL);  
double min_dist  = (stops_lvl + 5) * SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_POINT);
```

```
// Only modify if new SL respects broker minimum distance  
if(new_sl > current_sl && new_sl < bid - min_dist)  
   trade.PositionModify(_Symbol, new_sl, tp);
```

**Bug 3 — Breakeven at entry + 2 points.** The original code moved the SL to `entry + point * 2`. Two points. This almost always violated the broker's minimum stop level, causing silent rejection on every single breakeven attempt. Fixed by using `min_dist` instead.

## Part 5 — Capturing the Equity Spikes

After fixing the bugs and adding the regime filter, the EA traded properly. But a new problem appeared in the equity curve: the green line (equity) regularly spiked up 3–5%, then collapsed back. The blue line (balance) barely moved. Profits existed in the equity but never made it to the balance.

The cause was a fixed trailing stop of 1.5×ATR. If the price moves 4×ATR in your direction, a 1.5×ATR trail lets the price retrace 37% of the entire move before stopping out. You watch the equity spike and give almost all of it back.

The solution: a **stepped trailing stop** that tightens as profit grows.

```
Profit < 1×ATR    →   No trailing (let the trade breathe)  
Profit 1–2×ATR    →   Trail at 1.2×ATR   (room to run)  
Profit 2–3×ATR    →   Trail at 0.8×ATR   (tightening)  
Profit > 3×ATR    →   Trail at 0.5×ATR   (lock in gains aggressively)
```

```
double profit_atr = (bid - entry_price) / atr;  // for long positions
```

```
double trail_dist;  
if(profit_atr >= 3.0)  
   trail_dist = 0.5 * atr;   // very tight — protect big wins  
else if(profit_atr >= 2.0)  
   trail_dist = 0.8 * atr;   // medium  
else if(profit_atr >= 1.0)  
   trail_dist = 1.2 * atr;   // wide — don't get shaken out early  
else  
   return;  // under 1×ATR — no trailing at all yet
```

We also added partial position closing. When the trade reaches 2×ATR of profit, 50% of the position closes automatically, converting unrealized equity into realized balance. The remaining half continues with the tight trailing stop.

```
if(InpUsePartial && profit_atr >= InpPartial_ATR   
   && partial_done_ticket != current_ticket)  
{  
   double close_volume = MathFloor(lots * 0.50 / lot_step) * lot_step;
```

```
   if(trade.PositionClosePartial(ticket, close_volume))  
   {  
      partial_done_ticket = current_ticket;  // flag: once per trade  
      Print("Partial close executed: ", close_volume, " lots locked in");  
   }  
}
```

## Part 6 — The Complete Decision Flow

The balance and equity lines track closely throughout the year — a direct result of the partial closes and stepped trailing converting equity spikes into real balance. The system had a rough February 2025 (the regime filter hadn’t been tuned yet at that point in the optimization), recovered through March, and grew steadily from April through July before a normal consolidation period in Q4.

Compare this with the very first backtest from the same dataset:

```
FIRST VERSION    FINAL VERSION  
────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Net Profit           -$75.24         +$105.66  
Profit Factor          0.91            1.36  
Win Rate              48%             82.86%  
Max Drawdown          23.16%          6.60%  
Sharpe Ratio          -1.04           2.79
```

Every single metric improved. The win rate went from coin-flip to 83%. Drawdown dropped from 23% to 6.6%. The Sharpe ratio went from deeply negative to 2.79, which is genuinely strong for a systematic strategy.

## Part 7 — What I’d Do Differently

A few honest reflections:

The CVaR calculation assumes roughly normal returns, which forex returns aren’t — they have fat tails, especially around news events. A more robust implementation would use a longer lookback window or apply an extreme value distribution to the tail. The hybrid approach used here (average of parametric and historical CVaR) is a reasonable first step but not the final answer.

The feature weights are static. In the original paper, LightGBM retrains every quarter on fresh data, so importance weights naturally shift with market conditions. Our weights are fixed at initialization. An obvious improvement would be recalculating weights periodically based on recent signal performance — a lightweight online learning layer.

The regime filter is binary. Either the market is trending or it isn’t. A more nuanced approach would scale position size continuously with regime confidence — a market with ADX at 40 and DI separation of 20 points is much more clearly trending than one with ADX at 20 and DI separation of 5. Continuous scaling rather than binary on/off would likely improve consistency.

Finally, this system trades one pair. The paper’s portfolio construction layer allocates across multiple assets simultaneously to reduce correlation risk. Extending this to a basket of forex pairs with genuine minimum variance allocation across them is the most significant remaining piece of work — and the subject of a future article.

## Conclusion

The paper by Chen et al. is genuinely useful — not because you can port its code to MT5 and run it, but because its underlying framework is sound and translatable. The insight that price momentum dominates fundamental factors (confirmed by the importance scores in Figure 4) is directly actionable even with no balance sheet data. The CVaR framework is more rigorous than most retail position sizing methods. And the minimum variance approach provably beats equal-weighting when volatility differs between instruments.

The journey from paper to working EA involved more debugging than modeling. Three silent bugs in the trailing stop. A regime filter that was first too tight (zero trades), then too loose (too many losers). A threshold calibration that took multiple backtest iterations to land correctly.

That debugging process is, in my view, the most transferable part of this project. Academic papers present clean results. Real implementations live in the messy space between clean theory and the broker’s minimum stop level requirement at 3 a.m. on a Thursday.

The code is above. Build it, break it, improve it.
